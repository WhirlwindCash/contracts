# Whirlwind Cash Privacy Solution

### A fork of Tornado Cash for usable networks

Tornado Cash is a non-custodial Ethereum and ERC20 privacy solution based on zkSNARKs. It improves transaction privacy by breaking the on-chain link between the recipient and destination addresses. It uses a smart contract that accepts ETH deposits that can be withdrawn by a different address. Whenever ETH is withdrawn by the new address, there is no way to link the withdrawal to the deposit, ensuring complete privacy.

To make a deposit user generates a secret and sends its hash (called a commitment) along with the deposit amount to the Tornado smart contract. The contract accepts the deposit and adds the commitment to its list of deposits.

Later, the user decides to make a withdrawal. To do that, the user should provide a proof that he or she possesses a secret to an unspent commitment from the smart contract’s list of deposits. zkSnark technology allows that to happen without revealing which exact deposit corresponds to this secret. The smart contract will check the proof, and transfer deposited funds to the address specified for withdrawal. An external observer will be unable to determine which deposit this withdrawal came from.

You can read more about it in [this medium article](https://medium.com/@tornado.cash/introducing-private-transactions-on-ethereum-now-42ee915babe0)

Whirlwind Cash is based off Tornado Cash, yet supports [Binance Smart Chain](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/guides/bsc-intro.html). This makes it much more affordable to access the privacy critical to our lives. It also comes native with incentivisation to improve the privacy pool, where every deposit triggers earning of WIND.

## Whitepaper

**[TornadoCash_whitepaper_v1.4.pdf](https://tornado.cash/audits/TornadoCash_whitepaper_v1.4.pdf)**

## Was it audited?

Tornado Cash was audited by a group of experts from [ABDK Consulting](https://www.abdk.consulting), specializing in zero-knowledge, cryptography, and smart contracts.

During the audit, no critical issues were found and all outstanding issues were fixed. The results can be found here:

- Cryptographic review https://tornado.cash/audits/TornadoCash_cryptographic_review_ABDK.pdf
- Smart contract audit https://tornado.cash/audits/TornadoCash_contract_audit_ABDK.pdf
- Zk-SNARK circuits audit https://tornado.cash/audits/TornadoCash_circuit_audit_ABDK.pdf

Underlying circomlib dependency is currently being audited, and the team already published most of the fixes for found issues

## Requirements

1. `node v11.15.0`
2. `npm install -g npx`

## Usage

You can see example usage in cli.js, it works both in the console and in the browser.

1. `npm install`
1. `cp .env.example .env`
1. `npm run build` - this may take 10 minutes or more
1. `npx ganache-cli`
1. `npm run test` - optionally runs tests. It may fail on the first try, just run it again.

Use browser version on Kovan:

1. `vi .env` - add your Kovan private key to deploy contracts
1. `npm run migrate`
1. `npx http-server` - serve current dir, you can use any other static http server
1. Open `localhost:8080`

Use the command-line version. Works for Ganache, Kovan, and Mainnet:

### Initialization

1. `cp .env.example .env`
1. `npm run build:contract`

### Ganache

1. make sure you complete steps from Initialization
1. `ganache-cli -i 1337`
1. `npm run migrate:dev`
1. `./cli.js test`
1. `./cli.js --help`

Example:

```bash
./cli.js deposit BNB 0.1 --rpc https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
```

## Deploy Native Asset Tornado Cash

1. `cp .env.example .env`
1. Tune all necessary params
1. `npx truffle migrate --reset --f 2 --to 5`

## Deploy ERC20 Tornado Cash

1. `cp .env.example .env`
1. Tune all necessary params
1. `npx truffle migrate --reset --f 2 --to 4`
1. `npx truffle migrate --reset --f 6`

**Note**. If you want to reuse the same verifier for all the instances, then after you deployed one of the instances you should only run the 5th or 6th migration for the native asset or ERC20 contracts respectively (`--f 5 --to 5` or `--f 6`).
